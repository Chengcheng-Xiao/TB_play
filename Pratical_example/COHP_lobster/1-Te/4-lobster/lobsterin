! This is an example for the lobster control file lobsterin. ! (See, here we are using the comment function!)
! First, enter the energetic window in eV (relative to the Fermi level): 
COHPstartEnergy -15
COHPendEnergy 15
usebasisset pbeVaspFit2015
! Then, specify which types of valence orbitals to use: 
includeorbitals s p
! You can also specify the basis functions per element manually, e.g.: ! basisfunctions Ga 4s 4p
! basisfunctions Sr 5s 4s 4p ! Sr_sv potential
! Now define the pairs for which COHP analysis etc. should be done. ! The atoms are numbered as per order in the PAW-code control file. 

!cohpbetween atom 1 atom 1
cohpGenerator from 2.8 to 2.9
! If you are interested in single orbital COHPs, you can get all the pairs ! like s-s, s-p_x, ..., p_z-p_z. Uncomment this line to switch it on:
! cohpbetween atom 1 atom 2 orbitalwise
! If you want to generate the COHP pairs automatically, use this to include ! all pairs in a given distance range (in Angstrom, not in atomic units):
! cohpGenerator from 1.4 to 1.5
! cohpGenerator from 1.4 to 1.5 type Ga type Sr
! and in the latter case only between the specified elements
